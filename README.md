# TissueMNISTCNN
WWSI PostDiploma Image classification using Deep Learning models (CNNs) Project 

# Task
The task is image classification using Deep Learning models (CNNs). Each team is given
another dataset from MedMNIST.
# What has to be done?
- Find some domain knowledge regarding the task to solve (from a medical point of
view)
1. Custom CNN architecture
- propose architecture
- train model with various hyperparameters from scratch (apply such
techniques like early stopping and data augmentation)
- record experiments in the Experiment Management&Monitoring tool
- decide which variant is the best (define criteria)
2. Use model pretrained on Imagenet
- do fine-tuning with different hyperparameters
- record experiments in Experiment Management&Monitoring tool
3. Apply Explainable AI methods to investigate reasoning of the model
- try to reflect on explanations in regards to domain knowledge
- Prepare two presentations (1) for executives and (2) for technical experts
- Prepare arguments to strengthen the claim that the model will have good
performance after deployment
- Present during the class

The process should reflect CRISM-DM methodology.

Deliverables:

- two presentations to be presented on 26th January
- show the dashboard in the chosen Experiment Management&Monitoring tool
- github repository

Note: Download dataset with images of size 64x64
